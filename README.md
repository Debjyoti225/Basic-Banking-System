# Basic-Banking-System

The project was built as a part of virtual-internship with The Sparks Foundation. The Basic Banking System tries to implement the concepts of JavaScript while ensuring to adhere to the standards of a real-life online banking services. Crafted with an appealing front-end, the web-application provides the user the service of making transactions to a predefined list of customers, each having a definite bank balance. The provision of transaction first checks whether the transfering amount is greater than the user's available balance or not and only then sanctions the transaction. 

Also, after a succesful transaction, the updated balances are reflected in the user's and receiver's balance column. The web-application, is further equipped to store the information concerning the transactions and reflect the same through an alert when triggered to do so. The details include the remitter's and receiver's bank account details along with the date and time of the transaction. Additionally, a home and insight page has been attached along with the application to impart a real-life diversification to its aesthetics.

Hope you enjoy playing along the little functionalities!

Thanks!
